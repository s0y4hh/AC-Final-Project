## 📘 Introduction

CipherNest is an interactive project designed to allow users to explore and experiment with fundamental cryptographic algorithms. The purpose of CipherNest is to provide a hands-on learning experience for students and enthusiasts interested in cryptography, encryption, and security. Users can interact with different cryptographic methods, understand the process of encryption and decryption, and see how various algorithms function in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. To provide an educational platform for understanding the basics of cryptography.
2. To allow users to experiment with multiple cryptographic algorithms (symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing).
3. To demonstrate practical implementations of cryptographic techniques on both text and files.
4. To visualize the process and output of cryptographic operations for better comprehension.
5. To encourage further learning and experimentation in the field of cybersecurity.

### Application Architecture & UI

CipherNest features a user-friendly graphical interface that allows seamless switching between different cryptographic algorithms. The application is built using [specify framework or technology, e.g., Python with Tkinter, JavaScript with React, etc.], ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of use.

### Implemented Cryptographic Algorithms

#### 1. Caesar Cipher (Symmetric)
- **Type:** Symmetric Key Encryption
- **Background:** One of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
- **How it Works:** Each letter of the input is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Libraries Used:** [Specify if any, e.g., none or built-in string manipulation]
- **Integration:** Allows user to set the shift value and encrypt/decrypt text.

#### 2. Vigenère Cipher (Symmetric)
- **Type:** Symmetric Key Encryption
- **Background:** Uses a keyword to shift letters of the plaintext, creating a polyalphabetic cipher.
- **How it Works:** Each letter of the plaintext is shifted by the corresponding letter of the keyword.
- **Libraries Used:** [Specify if any]
- **Integration:** User inputs a keyword to perform encryption/decryption.

#### 3. RSA (Asymmetric)
- **Type:** Asymmetric Key Encryption
- **Background:** A public-key cryptosystem widely used for secure data transmission.
- **How it Works:** Uses two keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
- **Libraries Used:** [E.g., PyCryptodome, Crypto.PublicKey]
- **Integration:** Key generation, encryption, and decryption of text or files.

#### 4. SHA-256 (Hash)
- **Type:** Hash Function
- **Background:** Cryptographic hash function producing a 256-bit hash value, commonly used in security applications.
- **How it Works:** Converts input data into a fixed-size string of bytes.
- **Libraries Used:** [E.g., hashlib]
- **Integration:** Users can hash text or files and compare hash outputs.

*Add more algorithms if implemented, following the template above.*
